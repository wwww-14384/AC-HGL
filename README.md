# AC-HGL
AC-HGL:Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning through Adaptive Correlation for Stock Movement Prediction
Here is the official code and supplementary materials for the GC-AGL model:AC-HGL is a model designed for stock price prediction. Then AC method constructs multiple correlation graphs and aggregates them to acquire the adaptive correlation representations. And HGL method aggregates different representations of heterogeneous graphs via varying feature strengths, and optimizes the dynamic weights based on the contributions of different modules.

Our initial experiments were conducted within a complex business codebase developed based on Qlib.
The original code is comprehensive, and we will release the dataset and core code in the future.

Box Plot and Gaussian Distribution of P-Values for Cross-Moran's I.
Figure respectively compare the box plot and Gaussian distributions of Cross-Moran's I p-values across different trading days (i.e., 2008 crisis versus 2019 normal markets). The distribution predominantly clusters around p < 0.05, indicating statistically significant results. This stability persists even when including extreme trading days, demonstrating the model's robustness to market conditions. Crisis Market: The box is concentrated in the low-value range (approximately 0.0 to 0.2), with a low median. The overall value range is small and relatively low. Normal Market: The box has a large span, with a high median. The value range extends from low to 1.0, and the overall distribution is more dispersed with higher values. Because the impact of crisis events on the market is clear and strongly directional, the relationship between variables shows "strong significance" — corresponding to a low p-value in statistical tests (the lower the p-value, the stronger the significance, that is, the more sufficient the evidence that "the event impact is certain"), making it easier to reject the null hypothesis. In the normal market, multiple factors such as macroeconomics, industry cycles, individual companies, and policy expectations work together, and investors have diverse trading logics, leading to the amplification of "differences" in market volatility and a more dispersed numerical distribution.
