# AC-HGL
AC-HGL:Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning through Adaptive Correlation for Stock Movement Prediction
Here is the official code and supplementary materials for the GC-AGL model:AC-HGL is a model designed for stock price prediction. Then AC method constructs multiple correlation graphs and aggregates them to acquire the adaptive correlation representations. And HGL method aggregates different representations of heterogeneous graphs via varying feature strengths, and optimizes the dynamic weights based on the contributions of different modules.

Our initial experiments were conducted within a complex business codebase developed based on Qlib.
The original code is comprehensive, and we will release the dataset and core code in the future
